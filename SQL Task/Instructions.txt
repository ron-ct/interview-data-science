Given two tables, company and trades, write an SQL query that adds up the total import and export amounts for each country.

The company table has the following columns:
name (the name of the company)
country (the country where the company is located)

The trades table has these columns:
tradeID (uniquely identifies the particular transaction)
buyer (the name of the buying company)
seller (the name of the selling company)
amount (the dollar value of the trade)

Rules:
Imports: When a company (in a given country) buys goods from a company in a different country.
Exports: When a company (in a given country) sells goods to a company in a different country.
Assumption: Each company belongs to exactly one country.
The output columns should be country, imports, exports.
Both imports and exports should be displayed.

Your task: Write an SQL query that, for each country, calculates:
The total value of imports.
The total value of exports.
