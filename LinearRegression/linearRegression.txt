Real Estate Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Context:
You are provided with a CSV file named real_estate.csv that contains data about various real estate properties. Your task is to build a linear regression model that predicts the selling price of a property based on its features.

CSV File Structure:
The file contains the following columns (note that there may be additional columns not listed here, I dont remember all that were there; please handle common real estate features):

Price: The selling price of the property.
Size: Total area of the property in square feet.
Location: Neighborhood or area where the property is located (categorical).
Number_of_Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms.
Number_of_Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms.
Lot_Size: Size of the lot in square feet.
Year_Built: Year the property was constructed.
Garage_Size: Number of cars that the garage can accommodate.
Property_Type: Type of property (e.g., Single-Family, Condo, Townhouse).
Distance_to_City_Center: Distance from the property to the city center in miles.
Your Task:

Data Extraction & Preprocessing:

Load Data.
Handle Missing Values: Decide how to deal with missing or invalid data.
Feature Engineering.
Perform any additional feature scaling or transformation as needed.
Model Building.

Linear Regression: Implement a linear regression model using the training data to predict Price.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using appropriate metrics 


Deliverables:

Code: Provide a Python script /Jupyter Notebook that includes your solution. Your code should be well-organized and commented to explain each major step.

Additional Considerations:
1. Assume that the CSV file may contain some noise or missing values.
2. Focus on creating a clean, maintainable codebase, as you would in a real-world scenario.
